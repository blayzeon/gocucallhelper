# Verification
Official Guide Link:
https://thehub.georgiasown.org/WebDAV/Member%20Services/Member%20Services%20Verification%20Procedure%2010.03.24.pdf

These are the procedures for verifying a member when they call in to Member Services. You must correctly verify every call. If the member is not able to pass verification, do not assist them.

*** Contact a Member Services Support Team Member or ERM-Security immediately should you suspect fraud on a member’s account. ***

Guiding Points and Requirements: 
	• The member must always provide their verbal password if there is one available. You may not provide password hints.
	• Some members have a note to "ID Password Only" which means only a name, account number and password is needed for verification unless Full Verification is required. Director-level Support Team member are the only people allowed to add these notes.
	• If you call a member back the same day that you have already verified them, you do not need to verify them again. Note:
		○ The number you're calling them on must be listed in DNA
		○ You must state that you are "conducting a callback on a recorded line"
	• If a fully verified member requests that you speak to someone on their behalf, you must advise that it applies to the current call only.
		○ If they request ongoing access, they must be added to the account/loan.
	• If the member's information changed recently (address, email, phone), extra caution should be taken
		○ A recently changed email cannot be used as an Out of Wallet Question
		○ A recently changed phone number cannot be used for Quiq code verification
	• Do not perform verification when 3rd parties are listening in. Call the member back before verifying them.
	• Member Service Support handles relay calls, for example, calls from the Georgia Relay Service for the Deaf.
	• If the call gets disconnected, you must call the member back unless they were abusive towards you.  If the call was abusive, perform the following steps:
		○ Detail the interaction with a note (expires in 2 years)
		○ Notify Member Services Support of the inappropriate behavior
	• If there is no answer on the other line, read the following script and disconnect the call:
		○ "Caller, I am unable to hear you. If you are there, please be sure that your line is not muted." - wait 3 seconds
		○ Caller, I am sorry that I was unable to assist you. If you still need help, please call us back at (404) 874-1166. Thank you."

The call will come in three different ways on SmartSuite within Interaction Desktop. You will need to verify the member differently depending on how it connects. Please note, that if the member is requesting a service that requires full verification, you must always verify them as "Blank/Full Verification".

Full Verification Requests:
	• Giving permission for an MSR to speak with a person that is not on their account/loan 
	• Closing a Savings account or Membership 
	• One Time Passcode (OTP) for Payrailz
